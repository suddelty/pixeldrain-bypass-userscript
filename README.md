# Pixeldrain Download Limit Bypass

[![Install with Tampermonkey](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20with-Tampermonkey-00485B.svg)](https://github.com/suddelty/pixeldrain-bypass-userscript/raw/refs/heads/main/bypass_script.user.js)

A userscript that enhances Pixeldrain with bypass download functionality and download manager support to improve your downloading experience.

## Features

- **Download Bypass Button**: Download files using bypass links that circumvent Pixeldrain's download limits
- **Show Bypass Links Button**: View all bypass URLs with copy and save options
- **Download Manager Support**: Works seamlessly with external download managers (IDM, JDownloader, etc.) for bulk downloads

## Important Notes

- The bypass service limits download speeds to approximately 1mbps to prevent abuse and maintain service stability.
- Some file types (videos, images, PDFs) may open in your browser instead of downloading.
  - Right-click the bypass link and select "Save link as..."
- If using a VPN and the script doesn't work, try temporarily disabling it or switching servers.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager (like Tampermonkey) for your browser
2. Click [here](https://github.com/suddelty/pixeldrain-bypass-userscript/raw/refs/heads/main/bypass_script.user.js) to install the script

After installation, you'll see two new buttons in the left sidebar on Pixeldrain pages:

- **"Download Bypass"** - Direct download using bypass links
- **"Show Bypass Links"** - View bypass URLs in a popup
